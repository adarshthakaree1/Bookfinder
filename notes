Book Finder is a simple and powerful web application that
allows users to search for books by title, author, or subject
using the Google Books API. It provides a smooth search 
experience with debounced API calls to avoid excessive requests 
and supports pagination for browsing through multiple pages of results.

Features:
 Search Books by title, author, or keyword
 Debounced Search – prevents API calls on every keystroke
 Pagination – navigate through next/previous pages of results
